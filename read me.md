CartPole Deep Q-Learning Project
Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to solve the CartPole-v1 environment using reinforcement learning. The agent interacts with the environment, learns to balance a pole on a cart, and optimizes its actions through a neural network model. The project uses techniques such as Q-learning, experience replay, and epsilon-greedy exploration to improve the agent's performance over time.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
OpenAI Gym: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides the CartPole-v1 environment used in this project.
TensorFlow/Keras: A deep learning library used for creating the neural network that predicts Q-values for state-action pairs.
NumPy: A package for numerical computing, used for efficient mathematical operations.
Matplotlib: A plotting library used to visualize rewards, successes, and failures over time.
Project Description
In this project, we implement the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to solve the CartPole-v1 environment provided by OpenAI Gym. The objective is to balance a pole on a cart by applying left or right forces. The agent learns through trial and error and receives rewards for keeping the pole balanced.

The agent's learning process involves the following components:

Epsilon-Greedy Exploration: The agent explores the environment randomly (exploration) and exploits its learned knowledge (exploitation) using an epsilon-greedy strategy.
Deep Q-Network: A neural network predicts the Q-values for each state-action pair. This helps the agent select the best actions based on past experiences.
Q-Learning: The agent updates its Q-values based on the received rewards and the maximum future Q-value (temporal difference learning).
Model Saving: The trained model is saved and can be loaded for future use or testing.
The goal of this project is to train an agent that can successfully balance the pole for a given number of timesteps in the CartPole-v1 environment.

Installation
Prerequisites
To run the project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenAI Gym
NumPy
Matplotlib
Install Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, you can use the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies individually using:
pip install gym tensorflow numpy matplotlib

Running the Project
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cartpole-dqn.git
cd cartpole-dqn

Run the main Python script to start training:
python train.py

After training is complete, the model will be saved as best_cartpole_model.h5. You can use this model to test the agent's performance by running:
python test.py

Visualize the training process and results with Matplotlib plots (rewards, successes, and failures per episode).

How It Works
Deep Q-Network (DQN): The agent uses a neural network with two hidden layers to approximate the Q-values. The input to the network is the state of the environment, and the output is the predicted Q-values for each action.

Experience Replay: The agent stores past experiences in a replay buffer. During training, it randomly samples experiences from the buffer to break the correlation between consecutive experiences, which helps improve training stability.

Epsilon Decay: The agent starts with a high epsilon value (exploration) and gradually decreases it to focus more on exploiting its learned knowledge (exploitation) as training progresses.

Target Q-Value Update: The agent calculates the target Q-value for each state-action pair and updates its model based on the difference between the predicted and target Q-values.

Rendering: The environment is rendered during the training process to visualize the agent’s actions. This helps in observing the agent's learning progress.

Results
After training, the agent should be able to balance the pole for a significant number of timesteps (typically 195 or more out of 200). The agent’s performance can be visualized through graphs showing rewards, successes, and failures for each episode.

Future Improvements
Experience Replay Optimization: Implementing prioritized experience replay to sample more informative experiences.
Double DQN: Using two networks (target network and main network) to reduce overestimation bias in Q-value updates.
Dueling DQN: Introducing separate value and advantage estimations to improve training efficiency.
A3C / PPO Algorithms: Exploring advanced reinforcement learning algorithms such as A3C or PPO for improved performance.
